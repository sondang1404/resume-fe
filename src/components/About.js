              Hello! My name is Black Valentine and I enjoy creating things that
              live on the internet. My interest in web development started back
              in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumble themes - turns
              out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about
              HTML & CSS!
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
              advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
              student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
              accessible, inclusive products and digital expreriences at
              Upstatement for a variety of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need
              to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
            <ul className="about__list">
              {technologyList.map((item, index) => {
                return (
                  <li key={index} className="about__item">
                    <span>{item}</span>
                  </li>
                )
              })}
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className="about__left">
            <picture>
              <img
                src={avatar}
                alt="avatar"
              />
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
